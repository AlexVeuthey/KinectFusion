1. fuse globally 2 POV of same scene, then fuse them together
2. even try moving for the drapes scene
3. look into point cloud merging instead of voxels

4. translation only for the 2POV of drapes & make them flatter
5. check correspondances in matlab (if want to focus on large baseline)
otherwise small movements (5-10cm apart)
can try with markers to recover the camera rotation/translation and use it in the fusion/alignment (ARtoolkit)
4 markers => homography

- save the kinect device variable
