1. recover transform using manual (for translation) or marker based approach
2. apply the transform to one of the point clouds
3. ICP between the two point pre-aligned point clouds
4. fusion between the ICP-aligned point clouds

method 1: manual (translation only)
- recover translation with color images
- find real-world translation using correspondances of points

method 2: automatic (marker-based) transform recovery
- setup ARtoolkit for multiple markers recognition
- recover (output from ARtoolkit) the transform between 2 frames

method 3!!! automatic feature matching w/o markers!
